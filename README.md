## Repetier FW for the Da Vinci 1.0 with an E3Dv6 extruder.

This is a fork of the excellent port of the Repetier FW for Da Vinci printers by luc-github [here](https://github.com/luc-github/Repetier-Firmware-0.92).

This project adds the changes I have introduced to support the replacement of the stock extruder with an E3Dv6 extruder in my Da Vinci 1.0 first generation.

TODO: add details of the HW and FW modifications.
